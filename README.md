# Let's Do Something

Hi! This is my first project working with Angular.

This web app is an activity manager that gets data from Bored API: https://www.boredapi.com/

On the Explore view, you get a list of nine random activities that you can either save or discard.

On the History view, you can see your saved list, your discarded list or both.

You can also save or discard activities that you already classified into one or another list.
